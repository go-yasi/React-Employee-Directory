# React Employee Directory

## Description
The goal of this assignment was to create an employee directory with React. 

## User Story
"As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information."  
  
Business Context: An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.  

## Acceptance Criteria
Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. The user should be able to sort the table by at least one category, and filter the users by at least one property.
